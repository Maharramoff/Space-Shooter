### Note
I am not a professional game developer, this is my hobby activity during non-working time. So, it does not pretend to be a full-fledged game at all and is not intended to demonstrate javascript techniques or best practices. Its just a space shooter tech demo. If someone is going to create a real space shooter, perhaps this will be the minimum point from which to start turning it into a game.
